# Algorithmic Problem Solving & Competitive Programming

Welcome to my repository of algorithmic solutions! This workspace contains my solutions to various data structure and algorithm problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codewars.

## 🎯 Purpose
As a Software Engineering student, I use this repository to track my progress, refine my problem-solving skills, and maintain a consistent daily coding habit. It serves as my personal library of algorithms and data structures, helping me prepare for technical interviews and competitive programming contests.

## 💻 Languages
I primarily solve problems using:

* **C++**: My core language for competitive programming, utilizing the Standard Template Library (STL) for optimal execution time and memory management.
* **Python**: My go-to for rapid prototyping, complex string manipulations, and writing clean, concise scripts.
* **Java / C / C#**: Used for exploring alternative approaches, practicing different paradigms, and object-oriented implementations.

## 📁 Repository Structure
The repository is organized logically by platform, and then by topic or problem type, to make navigation easy.
